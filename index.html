    Hello, my name is Derick Fuentes, and I would like to share an introduction about myself.

I was born in Ottawa, Ontario and I have a job where I work to gain experience. During this time, I'm studying at Algonquin College where I am learning to become an Interactive Media Designer to share my creativity for clients who need a website. Furthermore, Iâ€™ve learned video production, photography and learning to stylize websites that could bring the clients attention. I wish to improve more on coding because I find it challenging, but I'm willing to give it my best to improve.
